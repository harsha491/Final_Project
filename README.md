# Title: Monte Carlo Intervension

## Team Member(s): harsha491


# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
(be sure to read the instructions given in course Moodle)

The purpose of this project is to simulate the health impact and savings a small NGO serving 300-500 people can have through simple interventions and counseling for clinically preventable diseases over a period of three years.

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty

Number of people visiting the NGO for health related issues
Fluctuations year on year for three years
Clinically Preventable Disease vulnerability
Possible chronic or acute side effects of the existing condition
Effectiveness of Intervention
Long term adherence to intervention

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:

Simple intervensions of clinically preventable diseases can have a lasting impact on quality of life and save thousands of dollars in health care.
My results have proved that there is a considerable health care cost saved with simple health interventions. An individual can save between $100-$1000 a year by adhering to councelling on Alcohol and over $1000 a year in health care costs calculated based on the quality of adjusted life years by keeping away from smoking. 

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)


## Instructions on how to use the program:
Run the file Alcohol to find simulated results for cohort, individual intervention, related histograms, impact of the NGO and impact on individual health care cost.
Run the file Tobacco to find simulated results for cohort, individual intervention, related histograms, impact of the NGO and impact on individual health care cost.

# Modify values in Alcohol to simulate for various outcomes :
alc_chr: Alcohol-attributable life years lost to chronic conditions and Range: =/- 20%
alc_acu: Alcohol-attributable life years lost to acute conditions and Range: =/- 20%
alc_m_chr: Alcohol-attributable morbidity-related QALYs lost from chronic conditions
alc_m_acu: Alcohol-attributable morbidity-related QALYs lost from acute conditions
alc_scr: Delivery of screening and counseling
alc_adh: Adherence with screening
alc_scr_eff: Effectiveness of counseling at changing behaviour
alc_eff_chr: Efficacy of behaviour change at reducing chronic conditions
alc_eff_acu: Efficacy of behaviour change at reducing acute conditions
alc_t_eff: Weighted efficacy of behaviour change at reducing total alcohol-attributable QALYs lost
alc_patient_volume: number of patients interviened by the NGO
Fluctuation: year on year patient traffic fluctuation
QALY_dollars: QALYs converted to dollars
