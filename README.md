Create a FORK of this repository to store your code, data, and documentation for the final project. Detailed instructions for this assignment are in the course Moodle site.  The reason I'm asking you to fork this empty repository instead of creating a stand-alone repository is that it will be much easier for me and all students in the course to find all of our projects for code review and for grading. You can even get code review from students in the other section of IS590PR this way.

Even though your fork of this repository shall be public, you'll still need to explicitly add any students on your team as Collaborators in the Settings. That way you can grant them write privileges.

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
(be sure to read the instructions given in course Moodle)

The purpose of this project is to simulate the health impact and savings a small NGO serving 300-500 people can have through simple interventions and counseling for clinically preventable diseases over a period of three years.

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

number of people visiting the NGO for health related issues
fluctuations year on year for three years
Clinically Preventable Disease vulnerability
Possible chronic or acute side effects of the existing condition

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:

Simple intervensions of clinically preventable diseases can have a lasting impact on quality of life and save thousands of dollars in health care.

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
